- 1 world state manager per instance
 - per-instance world state structure:
    
    uint32 StateId - world state id
    int32 ZoneMask - if set to -1, sends for all zones, otherwise sends only for this zone. (world pvp!)
    int32 FactionMask - if set to -1, sends for both factions, otherwise sends for one faction
    uint32 Value - value of world state


 - per-player world state manager
    
    - there are also world states that are per-player, not per-zone/faction
    - e.g. display of the capture bar
      - a player will have a world state manager for this, structure:
           uint32 StateId
           uint32 Value

      - OR! for now we are just going to use the SendWorldStateUpdate handler 
           - they use no bandwidth
           - no point keeping them persistant/stored unless we need to use them?
           - things like control points will have a list of inrange players they will disable the state from when they go out of range anyway

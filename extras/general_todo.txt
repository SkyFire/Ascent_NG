! test first then impelement if necesary !

SMT_DUMMY - work on this
SMT_CAST_TIME - does not depend on charges, add this ability
SMT_RESIST - not used. There is only 1 spell what is veryrarely used
SMT_TRIGGER - check if this is used

SMT_RESIST_DISPEL - check if it is used
- !help : Flameblade = 7806, Bonespike= 16550, Bone Shards = 17014,Blessing of Sanctuary=20911,Worgen's Spite=30564,Shadow Shield=31976,Fel Fire = 32008,Shadowguard = 32861,Thorns=34343,Energy Flare =35922,Arcane Shield=36640,Prismatic Shield=38905,Shadow Strikes=40334,
- deadly poison trigger maybe. This is a weapon enchant ?. Also added aurastate so envenom can be casted too

==========================================================================
! Features !
- make a proper loading for auras. Should restore caster guid, charges, procflags....
- in world.cpp,line 788 removed stormstrike effect 0 until find a solution for : spell is casted on target and should apply 1 aura, but it also adds the other 2 effects that should be aplied only to caster.
- a lot of spells have wrong trigger spell id. Lightning shield, Parry Mastery ...Make a tool to find them all and see what can be done for them.
- some creatures should not enter or exit water. ex : spider - fish.
- handleproc is getting huge, maybe we should break it into pieces
- maybe rewrite procspell on spell. There are like 140 spells who use this, and to function correctly most of them would need this
- hunter : curently you can equip only 1 Ammo Bag. This is wrong (INV_ERR_CAN_EQUIP_ONLY1_AMMOPOUCH). It should only use effects of ammo bag that is actively used.
- paladin - illumination - nasty spell. Started workin on it but just delayed it for a while
- make Fishing chair item spell work. Should spawn a chair and auto sits you in it. While your fishing.
- elemental creatures do not have fizical attack but magic type, add dmg type to db load
- add new column to quests to be able to make required_quest_alternative
- make cooldown cheat update client cooldown too
- make DOTs do not require infront check
- summon guardians not working : 49,
- there should a trigger type named : proc on effect - so we can know the effect value at which we proc
- make a spellgroup generator for featured spells
- channeled spells have a big chance to get interrupted
- crusader strike and seal of blood do not gain extra dmg from stacked effect
- "As I noticed some of OP statements were added to warrior_todo I would like to point out Rage Generated By Taking Damage part of wowwiki formulas and add fact that spell dmg does not generate any rage at all, as well as spell crits does not trigger abilities like Enrage... this implies to all rage users (warrior, druid bear form)"
- check this spell : 40018
- Casting a spell should cancel a spell being channeled. e.g. While casting Blizzard I can start to cast Frostbolt, and Blizzard should automatically be stopped.
- repeatable quests that can be made only once per day
- "would be cool if someone fixed the new player inspect tab where you can see the talent points. I think it came with 2.3"
- Quagmirran's eye proc doesn't work. Never got the spell haste proc off any harmful spell.
- The lightning Capacitor- no electrical charge saved from spell criticals so it doesn't fire off lightning bolts.
- effect 121 should come before eff 31. (bonus calc -> damage) or bonus will not be applied
- intellect does not increase spell crit chance
- detect all proc spells that have same name as mother spell and can be stacked more then once
- cast druid ranquility on target then target enters instance .. tranquility will remain on him
- buged ? : avenger's shield, avenging wrath, judgement of seal of crusader (when they judge the seal of crusader the mob gets is like using the judgment of seal of light)

==========================================================================
! BUGS !
- creatures keep yelling no content messgs
- some teleportation spells have target_type 17 and they will not generate a target to be teleported. Right now there is a special if for this in spell.cpp (ugly)
- some minable things give the : item is beeing used error. There should be a timeout for this
- fear, slowes you down forever
- getrandomplayer,getmosthated not woking ?
- why do we need enslavecount ?
- Pets - You can attack players from your faction with pets
- starfire stuns the caster instead of target.
- i can request and accept at the same time a duel ? request on second login char the duel then simply accept it :S
- "if I have a mob or player dotted when I use fear on them, it causes me to become feared when the dot ticks. This one really pwns warlocks, priests and even warriors."
- "you can have 2 water elementals"
- you gain combo point even on spell failed (backstab)
- you should gain mining skill if the bar has been filled instead on cast action
- some say that proc spells are not removed after they proc from items and taking items off you. Is this the same unexistatn bug as with talent unlearning ?
- shadow trance is not removed by first shadow bolt
- feign death kills player if it expires

Broken talent groups

- Gift of Nature (druid), Healing Light (Paladin), Purification (Shaman) don't work, tho Spiritual Healing (Priest) works ?:)
- Talents reducing mana of spells which cost % of base mana don't work. Improved Blink, Natural Shapeshifter (this one works until u move), Absolution, Purifying Power, ...

//// - just taking this home 
BLESSING OF LIGHT la paladin: dai heal exagerat de mare (12k+ fara iteme la lvl 70) cu blessul pe target. COMBUSTION la mage: odata activat la fiecare fire spell se stackeaza pana ajunge la 10x si ai crit chance 100%. VICTORY RUSH la warrior : Dupa ce omori mob/player care iti da honor/xp ramane activat mereu si nu 20 de secunde cat ar trebui. Cum abilitatea nu cere rage devine deja exploit. SACRIFICE la warlock: Dupa ce sacrifici o data voidu` si iti da shieldu` de 3k absorb poti da shieldul mereu fara a mai avea nevoie de pet pt a folosi abilitatea. In PVP poti iesi din combat doar cu un simplu esc. E aproape imposibil sa bati un rogue care te tine numai in stealth/ cheap shot / kidney shot si iar stealth. Cand folosesti unstuck te da sub harta.

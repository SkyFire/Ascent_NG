How to test: Make a rogue learn talent "Surprise attacks" from "Combat" talent tree then duel sombodey and use eney of the finishing moves listet meney times to make shure the dont get dodged

* Vanish - doesn't remove effects such as Frost Nova.
* Cloak of shadows - grants immunity, but doesn't remove magic effects (worked long time ago, but no immunity)
* Shiv - no effect, should apply off hand poison
* Rupture - doesn't scale with attack power
* Relentless Strikes - has a 20% chance per combo point to restore 25 energy, thus guarantees that 5 point combos restore 25 energy (or cost 25 energy less), however it doesn't work for all finishers, including Eviscerate and Expose Armor. It does work for Kidney Shot and Slice and Dice, from what I've seen.
* Lethality

Ruthlesness ads 2 combo points (again)

Rogue - Relentless Strikes - procs 2 times ?

Opportunity increases the damage of your Mutilate by 4%, 8%, 12%, 16%, or 20%.
Lethality increases the critical strike damage bonus of your mutilate by 6%, 12%, 18%, 24%, or 30%.

Spells :
1.Envenom :
Envenom is a Rogue Assassination ability learned at level 62. Used as a finishing move it consumes your Deadly Poison doses on the target and deals instant poison damage. One dose is consumed for each combo point.

Rank Damage Level Cost
1 168 - 838 damage 62 5 31
2 204 - 1018 damage 69 10 80

Damage Calculation Formula
Rank 1
1 dose: (144+AP*0.03) damage
2 doses: (288+AP*0.06) damage
3 doses: (432+AP*0.09) damage
4 doses: (576+AP*0.12) damage
5 doses: (720+AP*0.15) damage
Rank 2
1 dose: (180+AP*0.03) damage
2 doses: (360+AP*0.06) damage
3 doses: (540+AP*0.09) damage
4 doses: (720+AP*0.12) damage
5 doses: (900+AP*0.15) damage

2.Rupture
Finishing move that inflicts a bleeding wound on the target, working as a DoT. ( can you read -> bleeding wound -> no reduce from armor ffs its like WOUND of warrior ! )

Damage Calculation Formula
The rough formula for rupture(rank 7) damage is:

1pt = Attack Power * 0.04 + 324
2pt = Attack Power * 0.10 + 460
3pt = Attack Power * 0.18 + 618
4pt = Attack Power * 0.21 + 798
5pt = Attack Power * 0.24 + 1000
an interesting side effect is the damage per tick

1pt x 4 ticks at = Attack Power * 0.01 + 81
2pt x 5 ticks at = Attack Power * 0.02 + 92
3pt x 6 ticks at = Attack Power * 0.03 + 103
4pt x 7 ticks at = Attack Power * 0.03 + 114
5pt x 8 ticks at = Attack Power * 0.03 + 125

This has been reported since...MONTHS -> the damage from rupture CANNOT BE REDUCED BY ARMOR !! ( like now )
And should take bonus from Attack Power ( like now on ascent 2000+ do not takes ap bonus )

3.Garrote -> same as rupture.

Damage Calculation Formula
The basic Garrote damage formula:

Multiplier = 1 + (0.04 * Opportunity Rank) + (0.2 if Shadowstep+(.01 + .03 * Master of Subtlety)
Modifier = Attack Power * 0.18

Total Garrote Damage = (Garrote Rank + Modifer) * Multiplier
Damage Per Tick = Total Garrote Damage / 6
The following assumes that the character is a level 19 Rogue with 278 attack power, 5/5 Opportunity and Garrote Rank 1.

Example:

Multiplier = 1 + (.2) = 1.2
Modifier = 278 * 0.18 = 50.04 = 50

Total Garrote Damage = (144 + 50) * 1.2 = 232.8
Damage Per Tick = 232.8 / 6 = 38.8 Damage every 3 seconds

4.Shiv
Performs an instant off-hand weapon attack that automatically applies the poison from your off-hand weapon to the target. Slower weapons require more Energy. Awards 1 combo point. from ( Shiv attacks do proc Combat Potency. Spamming Shiv with a high-dps offhand with a speed less than 1.5 (costing 35 energy) can be very effective (given 1x 20 energy tick and a combat potency proc for another 15 energy). The high special-attack rate this skill and talent synergy has other benefits- more hits means more chance on hit procs from gear, more mace spec procs, and any other goodies you have. )

5. Cloak of Shadows
Instantly removes all existing harmful spell effects and increases your chance to resist all spells by 90% for 5 sec
Last time was working only -> 90% chance to resist for 5 sec.
Also should remove Impairing/Slow effects and remove all DOT's ( Cannot remove Bleeding effects )


Riposte

I was successfully able to use envenom when I used deadly poison I and it will not work with any other level (it should)
